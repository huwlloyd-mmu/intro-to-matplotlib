    "Welcome to the __Jupyter Notebook__ for this short intro to matplotlib. Jupyter is a great way to work in Python; you can combine code, formatted text (using Markdown), plots (using Matplotlib), and maths (using LaTeX) in one interactive document. If you want to install Jupyter (or any python tools) the best way is to get [__Anaconda__](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), which is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Everything we do here will also work when running python interactively (at the command line) or in script mode (editing .py files and running them with python). \n",

    "Often the data you want to plot is in a text file. Numpy provides some powerful tools for reading data from files directly into numpy arrays. The following code reads two columns of data from a file, skipping the first two lines of header into a __2-dimensional__ numpy array. It then splits this array into two one-dimensional arrays for plotting. Arrays are split up using __array slicing__. This is a very powerful system, which we could spend all afternoon on, but the example here should be all you need for now."
