Jupyter is a great way to work in Python; you can combine code, formatted text (using Markdown), plots (using Matplotlib), and maths (using LaTeX) in one interactive document. If you want to install Jupyter (or any python tools) the best way is to get [__Anaconda__](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), which is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Everything we do here will also work when running python interactively (at the command line) or in script mode (editing .py files and running them with python). \n",
