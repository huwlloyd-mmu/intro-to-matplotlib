# Introduction to Python Matplotlib

## Science and Engineering Extracurricular Award Scheme 2018

Welcome to the Github page for the *Introduction to Python Matplotlib* short course which
forms part of the 2018 summer term Extracurricular Award Scheme in the Faculty of Science
and Engineering at Manchester Metropolitan University. The aim of the course is
to provide an taster of *matplotlib*, a data plotting library that enables
publication quality plots to created with a few lines of python.

We will be using __Jupyter__ to run Python. Jupyter is a python interface that runs in
the browser, and enables the creation of interactive documents that mix formatted text,
hyperlinks, interactive python code and plots.
