# Introduction to Python Matplotlib

## Science and Engineering Extracurricular Award Scheme 2018

Welcome to the Github page for the *Introduction to Python Matplotlib* short course which
forms part of the 2018 summer term Extracurricular Award Scheme in the Faculty of Science
and Engineering at Manchester Metropolitan University. The aim of the course is
to provide an taster of *matplotlib*, a data plotting library that enables
publication quality plots to created with a few lines of python.

We will be using __Jupyter__ to run Python. Jupyter is a python interface that runs in
the browser, and enables the creation of interactive documents that mix formatted text,
hyperlinks, interactive python code and plots.

### To download and run the notebook:

* First duplicate this page in another tab on your browser.
* The click the 'View on GitHub' button at the top of this page (you can view the instructions in the duplicated page...)
* Click the green 'Clone or Download' button and choose 'Download ZIP'
* On your H: drive, look for a folder called __My-Notebook__. If it's not there, create it.
* Copy the contents of the zip archive into this folder.
* Now open __Jupyter__ from the windows menu, find __Campus Applications > Python > Jupyter Notebook__ and open it
* Find the __SciEngMatplotlib.ipynb__ file in the browser window that opens, and open this file.
* Now continue in the notebook interface...
